    "# Introduction\n",
    "There are two kinds of energy in mechanical systems: Potential energy and Kinetic energy. Potential energy is stored energy. When this energy is released, it can be converted into kinetic energy---energy of motion. In this lab you will conduct two experiments to determine if all of the potential energy stored in a system can be converted into kinetic energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first experiment, you will convert gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy (using the hanging mass and pulley). In the second, you will convert spring potential energy to kinetic energy."
