    "# Introduction\n",
    "There are two kinds of energy in mechanical systems: Potential energy and Kinetic energy. Potential energy is stored energy. When this energy is released, it can be converted into kinetic energy---energy of motion. In this lab you will conduct two experiments to determine if all of the potential energy stored in a system can be converted into kinetic energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first experiment, you will convert gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy (using the hanging mass and pulley). In the second, you will convert spring potential energy to kinetic energy."

    "### Measuring the Spring Constant\n",
    "It will be easiest to measure the compression of the spring while it is on a long rod. This will keep the spring from bending while weights are applied to the spring. Place one end of the rod on the table, then place the spring on the rod, and then place a washer on top of the spring. You should then be able to measure the compression of the spring as a function of the masses you apply. A series of ten 100 g weights should give you a good graph. (It might be instructive to start with ten 10 g weights before applying the remaining nine 100g weights to see if the spring constant is truly linear.)\n",
