    "Let us recall the four important equations in kinematics. First, the definitions of velocity and acceleration in the x-direction:  \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation} \n",
    "v_{x} \\equiv \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t} \n",

    "\\end{equation}  \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the two equations useful for objects moving under constant accelerations:  \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "x(t) = \\frac{1}{2} a_{x} t^2 + v_{o,x} t + x_{o}\n",

    "\n",
    "In the horizontal direction (the x-direction), there is no acceleration, so that $a_x = 0 m/s^2$. However, gravity contributes a constant acceleration downwards (the –y direction) such that $a_y= -g$ where $g \\equiv 9.81 \\pm 0.005 m/s^2$ so that $ \\delta g = 0.005 m/s^2$.\n",

Because there is no acceleration in the x-direction, you can use equation $\\eqref{eq:v_x}$ to start. But you will need to know how long the ball is in flight for. This requires solving for time in equation $\\eqref{eq:x_of_t}$ for the y-direction. You may need to use the quadratic formula."

But we can also fire the launcher straight up and utilize the y version of equation $\\eqref{eq:v_acc}$. <u>Remember that, in our coordinate system, $a_y$ is a negative value</u>.

    "## Uncertainty Analysis  \n",

    "Oftentimes, computing uncertainties can be tedious. Another method that is useful is to collect enough data so that one can trust the standard deviations in the collected data. For the purposes of this course---wherever you are allowed to do so---if you have taken at least five data points, you may use the standard deviation of those data points as your measurement uncertainty. Be aware that this number may be greater than your computed uncertainty; especially if you have few data points."
