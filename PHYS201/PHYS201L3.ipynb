    "### Objectives\n",
    "- To learn to take good measurements\n",
    "- To learn how to estimate and propagate uncertainties\n",
    "- To learn how to apply the kinematic equations to projectile motion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equipment\n",
    "- One PASCO Ballistic Pendulum apparatus with plastic projectile\n",
    "- Two (2) C-Clamps\n",
    "- One stopwatch\n",
    "- One 30 cm ruler\n",
    "- One two-meter stick\n",
    "- One sheet of carbon paper\n",
    "- Plain white or ruled paper\n",
    "- Tape\n",
    "\n",
    "### Safety\n",
    "1. **DO NOT STAND ON LAB CHAIRS**\n",
    "2. **Treat the launcher like a weapon:**\n",
    "    - **NEVER fire the launcher at anyone---even in jest.**\n",
    "    - **DO NOT “arm” the launcher until you’re ready to fire it.**\n",
    "3. When “arming” the launcher, place the ball on the pin and press down on the ball. Trying to press down on the bare pin can hurt your hand."

    "# Introduction\n",
    "Projectile motion is two-dimensional motion where one direction is under constant acceleration\n",
    "and the other direction is unaccelerated. In this lab, your job will be to compare the prediction for the range of a projectile given by the kinematic equations with the experimentally determined ranges."
