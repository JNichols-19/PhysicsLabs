    "Let us recall the four important equations in kinematics. First, the definitions of velocity and acceleration in the x-direction:  \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation} \n",
    "v_{x} \\equiv \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t} \n",
    "\\label{eq:v_x} \n",
    "\\end{equation}  \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "a_{x} \\equiv \\frac{\\Delta v_{x}}{\\Delta t}\n",
    "\\label{eq:a_x}\n",
    "\\end{equation}  \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the two equations useful for objects moving under constant accelerations:  \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "x(t) = \\frac{1}{2} a_{x} t^2 + v_{o,x} t + x_{o}\n",
    "\\label{eq:x_of_t}\n",
    "\\end{equation}  \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "v_{f,x}^2 - v_{o,x}^2 = 2 a_{x} \\Delta x\n",
    "\\label{eq:v_acc}\n",
    "\\end{equation}  \n",
    "\n",
    "The same equations can be used in the y-direction by replacing all the x’s with y’s.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the horizontal direction (the x-direction), there is no acceleration, so that $a_x = 0 m/s^2$. However, gravity contributes a constant acceleration downwards (the –y direction) such that $a_y= -g$ where $g \\equiv 9.81 \\pm 0.005 m/s^2$ so that $ \\delta g = 0.005 m/s^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you want to predict the distance that the projectile will go, you will need to combine two of the above equations. Because there is no acceleration in the x-direction, you can use equation $\\eqref{eq:v_x}$ to start. But you will need to know how long the ball is in flight for. This requires solving for time in equation $\\eqref{eq:x_of_t}$ for the y-direction. You may need to use the quadratic formula."

    "### Computing the “Muzzle Velocity”\n",
    "One of the most important values you will need for this experiment will be the “muzzle\n",
    "velocity,” $v_o$, of the launcher. One way to compute that velocity is to fire the launcher purely horizontally and use equation $\\eqref{eq:v_x}$. But we can also fire the launcher straight up and utilize the y version of equation $\\eqref{eq:v_acc}$. <u>Remember that, in our coordinate system, $a_y$ is a negative value</u>. By measuring the height that the ball attains and knowing the value of $a_y$, we can compute the “muzzle velocity” of the launcher."
