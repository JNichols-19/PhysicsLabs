    "# Introduction\n",
    "Newton’s second law, $a=F/m$, describes mass as that which resists acceleration. Rotational\n",
    "motion is very similar to linear motion in that a kind of force called a torque will cause an object to change its rotational velocity, $\\omega$. What resists such a change is not the mass of the object alone, but the way in which that mass is distributed. This combined effect of mass and its distribution is called the moment of inertia, *I*."

    "### Torque\n",
    "Torque is the “force” which causes an object to change the rate at which it is rotating. Examples of this kind of motion are: starting, stopping, or changing the “speed” with which a wheel is rotating; bending your arm at the elbow or leg at the knee; or even screwing (or unscrewing) a bolt or screw-top lid.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you try to remove a securely fastened bolt, you quickly find that it is much easier to use a\n",
    "wrench than it is trying to use your hand alone. The force you can apply to the bolt is, itself, not enough to cause the bolt to turn. But the force you can *apply* times a distance away from the\n",
    "center of rotation (often called the “lever arm”) is directly related to the magnitude of the torque you can generate (i.e. how effective you will be at getting the bolt to turn).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it seems obvious, it must be mentioned that not all forces are equally effective at generating torques. If you push or pull the wrench towards or away from the bolt, this will not cause the bolt to turn and you will generate no torque. Only the component of the force which is perpendicular to the lever arm has any effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "We roll all three of these concepts into the equation\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Where $\\Gamma$ is the torque, $r$ is the distance from the point where the force is applied to the center of the axis of rotation, and $\\theta$ is the angle between the two vectors $\\vec{r}$ and $\\vec{F}$."

The others are computed by taking numerical derivatives. Even though you might think it is better to take the angular acceleration data when you want it, this may not be the case. When you take your measurement, you should look carefully at each data set. The “noisier” the data, the worse your uncertainties will be. But if the angular acceleration data is not the proper data set to use, how do you get angular acceleration from the other data sets? You must fit your “good” data and use your knowledge of kinematics to extract the acceleration (and its uncertainty) from the fit."

After a few turns, the thread will have enough friction to stay in place. Continue rotating the stage with just a little tension on the thread.\n",

You can measure the angular acceleration due to friction by measuring it right after the system has been spun up by the hanging mass. Simply use Capstone to record the data right after a run while the system is still spinning (although this might be done after *every* run, time constraints might make it more appropriate to measure it one time for each of the two systems). Ten seconds of spin-down measurement should be sufficient. The moment of inertia should be the theoretical one you can compute by knowing the masses and dimensions of the system."
