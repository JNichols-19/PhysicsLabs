    "### Measurement of Velocity and Acceleration\n",
    "An acoustic sensor will measure the position of a cart on the airtrack at specific intervals of time. By use of the definition of velocity (Equation $\\eqref{eq:v_avg}$), we can compute the average velocity between two measurements. Notice that if we plot the position versus time, the fraction is the same as the rise divided by the run-- or the slope of the graph. By plotting *x* vs. *t*, we then find the slope of the graph and determine the velocity.\n",

    "### Analysis of Uncertainties\n",
    "It will be important to know what the uncertainties are in our computed velocities and accelerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, recall that a difference in position or time is a subtraction of two quantities:  \n",
    "\\begin{equation} \n",
    "\\Delta x = x_2 - x_1 \\nonumber\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",

    "(\\delta(\\Delta x))^2 = (\\delta x_2)^2 - (\\delta x_1)^2 \\nonumber\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in this case, the uncertainties $\\delta x_1$ and $\\delta x_2$ should be the same, so we can say that the uncertainty in our computed difference is:  \n",
    "\\begin{equation} \n",
    "\\delta(\\Delta x) = \\sqrt{2} (\\delta x) \\nonumber\n",
    "\\end{equation} \n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\delta x$ is the uncertainty in a single position measurement. We can say the same for time differences:  \n",
    "\\begin{equation} \n",
    "\\delta(\\Delta t) = \\sqrt{2} (\\delta t) \\nonumber\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\delta t$ is the uncertainty in a single time measurement. Notice that the uncertainty in the difference is larger than the uncertainty in each individual measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing the uncertainty in velocity, $\\delta v$, is a straightforward application of (R2). Looking at Equation $\\eqref{eq:v_avg}$ we have:  \n",
    "\\begin{equation} \n",
    "\\left(\\frac{\\delta v}{v}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\delta (\\Delta x)}{\\Delta x}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\delta (\\Delta t)}{\\Delta t}\\right)^2 \\nonumber\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation needs some work to become useful. Capstone will take data points at constant $\\Delta t$. But because $\\Delta x$ may be different for each measurement, we should try to remove it from our equation. We do this by using the definition of velocity to replace $\\Delta x$ with $v \\Delta t$:  \n",
    "\\begin{equation} \n",
    "\\left(\\frac{\\delta v}{v}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\delta (\\Delta x)}{v \\Delta t}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\delta (\\Delta t)}{\\Delta t}\\right)^2 \\nonumber\n",

    "### Leveling the Airtrack\n",
    "In order to study unaccelerated motion, we must ensure that gravity does not interfere. To do this, we must level the airtrack. The best method for leveling the airtrack is to use the cart itself to verify that it is not pulled one way or the other by gravity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Turn on the blower (you should be able to feel the air coming out of the drilled holes) and place a cart at the 100 cm mark.\n",

    "3. Release the cart without pushing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the cart tends to move to one side, you will need to raise that side (or lower the other side). This can be accomplished by rotating the feet on the two-foot support. If this is still not sufficient, you may need to place a folded sheet of paper under one of the two supports until the cart favors neither side. It’s OK if the cart slowly oscillates."

    "2. The sensor should be pointed directly at the reflector.\n",

    "4. The sensor must be centered on the track (look down over the sensor and make sure the center of the gold circle is over the ridge-line of the airtrack).\n",
