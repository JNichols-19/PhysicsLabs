    "# Introduction\n",
    "In 1686, Isaac Newton published his three laws of motion using information he gained from experiments performed by both Galileo Galilei and Johannes Kepler:\n",
    "1. If there is no net force, there is no acceleration\n",
    "2. If there is a net force, then *F = ma*\n",
    "3. If object A places a force on object B, then object B places an equal but opposite force on object A.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today you will be verifying Newton’s second law by using a known force to accelerate an airtrack glider, measuring that acceleration, and comparing it to the predicted acceleration."

The photogate measures the velocity of the glider as it passes through by timing how long the infrared LED is blocked by the object (sometimes called a “flag”) passing through and uses the definition of velocity:  \n",

    "### Force\n",
    "A proper prediction of the acceleration of the glider from Newton’s second law requires great care. It is imperative that you draw both free body diagrams (one for the cart and one for the hanging mass) to determine the acceleration of the system. Recall that the force of gravity on an object is given by $F = mg$ where $g \\equiv 9.81 \\pm 0.005 m/s^2$ so that $ \\delta g = 0.005 m/s^2$. You should find that the acceleration of the system is some fraction of g involving the masses of both the glider and the hanging mass."

The uncertainty in your acceleration, however, will have to be computed using the three equations in your Lab Manual.\n",

    "\n",
    "You will need to plot a few different points of tension versus acceleration for each cart mass---*at least five* points, but the more data you have, the better your graph will be. Therefore, pick a cart mass and measure its acceleration for each of five different hanging masses. Once you’ve done that, change the cart mass and repeat the experiment. Please make sure that your cart does not bounce back through the second photogate after striking the bumper at the end of the track.\n",

Always dedicate one team member to compute the results of your experiments (in this case, they should be computing your measured accelerations) to see if your data matches your theoretical prediction. If your data is *not* matching your predictions, you should stop *and* diagnose the problem (check both your experiment and your prediction) before continuing.\n",
